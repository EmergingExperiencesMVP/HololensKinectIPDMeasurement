# HololensKinectIPDMeasurement
Kinect v2 tool to measure interpupillary distance for HoloLens calibration.

This project is still very much in progress. I'm currently trying to track down inaccuracies in ipd measurements from the Kinect v2 face capture.

Next step is to make the UI more usable.

Finally, bells and whistles to make the analysis look more interesting than it really is.
